itc_benchmarks/01.w_Defects/null_pointer.c:238:2:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). 
itc_benchmarks/01.w_Defects/null_pointer.c:334:6:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120).  Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
itc_benchmarks/01.w_Defects/null_pointer.c:237:28:  [1] (buffer) strlen:Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
